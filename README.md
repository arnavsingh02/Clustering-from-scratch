This project demonstrates the implementation of clustering algorithms from scratch in Python without relying on pre-built machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. The focus is on understanding the mechanics of clustering, visualizing the clusters, and evaluating the quality of results using a silhouette score.

Features
Dataset Handling: Load and preprocess CSV datasets with automatic numeric column selection.

Custom Implementations:
KNN-style clustering (centroid-based iterative clustering, similar to K-Means).
K-Means clustering algorithm.
Hierarchical clustering (agglomerative approach).

Visualization: 2D cluster plots with centroids and color-coded groups.

Evaluation: Silhouette score calculation implemented manually.
